# AMS-595-Project-4
A project for AMS 595 creating functions to create a Mandelbrot set, compute a Markov chain for a random transition matrix and probability distribution, and perform two types of taylor approximation.
All code are ready to be run with specific specifications, but possible alterations are listed below.
For the Mandelbrot set, the number of points used in the range of x-values and y-values can be increased for more detail or lowered for faster computing.
The Markov chain code can be applied for more states by changing the dimensions of the transition martrix and the probability distribution.
The Taylor approximation code can be applied for any inputs of the function, start, end, degree, c_fixed, initial_degree, fianl_degree, and degree_step.
